# Alien Invasion - Pygame Project

This project is a simple 2D arcade-style game called **Alien Invasion**, developed as part of my CSC141 (Introduction to Computer Science) coursework. The game was built using **Python** and the **Pygame** library.

## Gameplay Overview

In **Alien Invasion**, the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down waves of aliens that move across and descend from the top. The game ends when either:
- All aliens are destroyed (you win),
- An alien reaches the bottom of the screen, or
- The player loses all available lives.

## Features

- Player-controlled spaceship that can move left/right and shoot bullets
- Alien fleet that moves and descends gradually
- Bullet-alien collision detection
- Scorekeeping
- Game-over conditions

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pygame** library

## How to Run the Game
